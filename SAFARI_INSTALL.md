# How to Install CalorieWatcher as a Web App on Safari (iOS)

CalorieWatcher has been configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means you can install it on your home screen and use it like a native app on your iOS device. Here's how to do it:

## Installation Steps for iOS Devices

1. **Open Safari**: Launch Safari browser on your iOS device (iPhone or iPad).

2. **Visit the CalorieWatcher website**: Navigate to the CalorieWatcher website by entering its URL in the address bar.

3. **Tap the Share icon**: Tap the Share icon (square with an arrow pointing up) at the bottom of the screen. If you don't see it, try tapping the top of the screen first to reveal the browser controls.

4. **Find "Add to Home Screen"**: Scroll through the share options and tap on "Add to Home Screen".

5. **Customize (Optional)**: You can customize the name of the app that will appear on your home screen.

6. **Tap "Add"**: Tap the "Add" button in the top-right corner of the screen.

7. **Launch from Home Screen**: The CalorieWatcher app icon will now appear on your home screen. Tap it to launch the app in standalone mode.

## Features Available in Standalone Mode

When you open CalorieWatcher from your home screen, you'll enjoy these benefits:

- **Full-screen experience**: The app runs without Safari browser controls, providing a more immersive experience.
- **Native-like appearance**: The app has its own icon and splash screen when launching.
- **Offline functionality**: Basic functions will work even without an internet connection.
- **Home screen access**: Quick access through an icon just like regular apps.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the installation or functionality:

- Make sure you're using Safari, as this feature is not available in other browsers on iOS.
- Ensure your iOS device is running a recent version of iOS.
- Clear your browser cache and try again.
- If the app doesn't appear to work offline, make sure you've visited the app while online first to cache the necessary files.

Enjoy using CalorieWatcher as a standalone app on your iOS device!
